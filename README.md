# PROFIT/LOSS PREDICTION IN PYRAMID SCHEMES USING MACHINE LEARNING

# Objective: 

ML model to predict whether a person at level h in the pyramid with a buying cost of c makes profit orloss.

• Implemented Logistic Regression and trained the model where 0 indicates loss and 1 indicates a profit.

• Removed outliers from dataset and visualized various parameters using plots like boxplot, pairplot, heatmap etc.

• Tested the model using a random dataset and analyzed the accuracy
